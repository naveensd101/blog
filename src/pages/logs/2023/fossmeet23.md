Day 1 is done and the starting was fun. Its really nice to see a lot of like minded people together and coding. I got a similar vibe to the medical conferences which I used to attend with my dad.

    Panel discussion

</br>

The event has the gist of tathva. But the majority of the people who attend the event have the same interest. So all the talks are fun. The flash is less but personally as a CS student I enjoy this event far better.

During the panel discussion one of the speaker mentioned that for contributing to a open source project, you don't really have to code. You can document your learning experience and that can potentially help a lot of people in learning the project. He mentioned that half of the job is to stay connected and talk with the people who are actively contributing.

I am just gonna fill the rest of the post with the pics of the event in almost chronological order. I don’t have the patience to articulate everything that hapened in detail.
