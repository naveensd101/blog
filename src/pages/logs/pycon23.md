    Day 1 at PyCon

## Day 0 : Before the event

Recently, I had the opportunity to attend PyCon India in Hyderabad. This blog post will provide an overview of my journey, the conference itself, and a few snapshots I captured along the way. 

PyCon took place on September 30th and October 1st. However, a hurdle emerged when I was due to fly out on September 29th. A Karnataka-wide bandh had been declared, meaning all taxi services to the airport were unavailable. I had planned to utilise the Atlassian Uber service, but the bandh eliminated that option. I considered various alternatives, including hiring an ambulance to ensure a safe arrival at the airport. 

[Faseem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faseem-shanavas-3a7801190) contacting the local bus service and confirming that KIA buses would operate despite the bandh. This information brought much-needed relief.

Earlier in the year, I had the chance to attend DebConf, but a scheduling clash with my team's offsite forced me to cancel. I was thus even more determined not to miss PyCon. Thanks to the KIA buses, I managed to reach the airport without any hiccups.

The Karnataka airport was a sight to behold, with its unique design.

I boarded a Vistara Airways flight to Hyderabad. The journey was brief, clocking in at around 45 minutes. To my surprise, they served a small snack pack onboard, an unexpected perk for a short domestic flight.

## Day 1 + 2 : Actual Event

The conference was conducted in JNTU university Hyderabad. Quite a nice college. But cant beat NIT Calicut for sure. The organisers arranged free e-auto rides inside campus. This was quite a nice thing considering the venues for different talks were scattered throughout the campus.

The conference food was delightful on both days.

I received a t-shirt and a jute bag as souvenirs.

## Hacker Culture

The first keynote speaker, [Jessica Greene](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica0greene/), emphasised the importance of maintaining a [hacker culture](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html). She suggested setting aside a day every week or two to collaborate with like-minded friends. This advice resonated with me, as it echoed a similar suggestion made by my college professor, Dr. Murali.

## Coding with Minecraft

[Anand's](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/programming-minecraft-with-websockets/) presentation on Minecraft Coding was quite interesting. He connected a Minecraft instance to his Python code, enabling him to procedurally generate anything buildable within Minecraft. Considering Minecraft has Turing Complete components, this would be a super power for creative coding. His use of ChatGPT to construct much of the boilerplate code was interesting, though he pointed out its limitations when dealing with complex tasks.

## FoxDot - Music and Python

[Sangarshanan's](https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot) presentation on creating music with Python was the most “fun” talk. His team at FoxDot is developing an open-source framework to program music. He even live-coded a short music piece, which was quite entertaining. The following youtube clip is taken from their website.

Unrelated but an old YouTube video that I had watched on “the art of coding”. I have rewatched this multiple times. 1hr long but worth the watch.

## FastAPI

[Marcelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelotryle/?locale=en_US), one of the maintainers of FastAPI, also held a keynote. However, as I've not worked with FastAPIs, most of his talk was a bit beyond my understanding.

## Pay-gap in Tech

Several talks highlighted the existing pay gap in the tech industry. I was surprised by this as I believed the tech industry was immune to such disparities. Clearly, I need to educate myself more on this topic.

Overall the conference had quite a few interesting discussions. If you have worked with python. Or is just curious about coding / computer science you will enjoy PyCon.
